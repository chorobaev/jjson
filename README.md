## Description
**JJson** is a Java library to serialize POJO(Plain Old Java Object) to Json string 
and Json to POJO. Provides basic configurations like changing a serialization name, excluding
properties from being serialized, and custom serializers for specific properties. 
Annotations are used to apply serialization options.

## Examples
See [this][1] piece of code for brief example.
